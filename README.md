## Introduction

Have you ever wondered whether you're getting a good deal on a laptop? With the Laptop Price Predictor, you can input the specifications of a laptop, and our machine learning model will estimate its price. This project uses a dataset of various laptops with detailed specifications to train a model that can make accurate price predictions.

## Features

- Input various laptop specifications such as processor, RAM, storage, screen size, and more.
- Get an estimated price for a laptop based on the input features.

## Dataset

We use a dataset of laptops that includes various features and their corresponding prices. This dataset is used for training and testing the machine learning model. You can find the dataset in the `data` folder.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. The dataset may require cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features. Check the Jupyter notebook for details on how this is done.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is a powerful tool to gain insights from the laptop dataset. In this project, we've used libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative visualizations that can help you better understand the data. Check the Jupyter notebook for the visualizations.

## Model Training

We use various machine learning algorithms to train a model, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The trained model can predict laptop prices accurately.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). This helps us understand how well the model is performing.

## Predicting Laptop Prices

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict laptop prices. Provide the specifications of a laptop, and the model will estimate its price for you.
